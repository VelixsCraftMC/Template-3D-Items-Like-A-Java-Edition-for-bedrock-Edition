> Create 3D-style items just like in Minecraft Java Edition using OptiFine. This template allows items to appear fully 3D, similar to OptiFine features, by using a resource pack with item renaming or CIT.
---

Items, weapons, and blocks are displayed with full visual models in the inventory, container slots, chests, shulkers, hotbar, on the ground, in item frames, first-person view, third-person view, and also when dropped — all rendered in 3D.

This will look similar to Minecraft: Java Edition when using OptiFine with a resource pack that changes item models. It can support 3D visuals, glow effects, and animations. I found a method to make this work in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, although there are still some limitations.

I’ve created this and you can use it as a template. Please don’t forget to credit me — you can use my name, GitHub, or YouTube channel. Also, please review the license information below:

## Creator Notes

**#1 VelixsCraftMCYT:**  
Sorry — update schedules will now be set to 2 updates per week for this template. I’m busy with real-world responsibilities and can’t push daily updates. Each change requires experimentation and coding time.

**#2 VelixsCraftMCYT:**  
The license allows you to use this template for large projects. Paid or premium addon projects are allowed. Donations are welcome — even small support helps. Around $2 is already meaningful support (or local equivalent). It helps fund further template development.

**#3 VelixsCraftMCYT:**  
I’m looking for contributors who can build Bedrock addons. Please contact me if you want to help — GitHub experience is required so we can collaborate and improve this template together.
